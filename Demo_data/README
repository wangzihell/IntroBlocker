## This is a toy demo that included the most novel part of the IntroBlocker algorithm.

We started from the pre-computed pairwise genetic distance file in the directory dist_file. These files were obtained by the Plink standard functiuon from the large-volume VCF files. These files contained 10 accessions on chromosome 2A.

First, we conducted intial clustering.
bash 2.Initial_grouping/script.sh

Then, we inferred the AHGs cross 2A chromosome.
bash 3.Ancestry_inference/script.sh

Next step, we conducted the Bayesian smoothing for the inferred AHGs.
bash 4.Bayesian_smoothing/script.sh

The expexted output could be found in the directory expected_output.
